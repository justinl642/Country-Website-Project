        <p>With over 17,000 islands, and a population of more than 250 million speaking 500 languages, Indonesia is an incredibly diverse country that can keep curious visitors busy for decades â€“ you could tick off beach-flopping, volcano-climbing, wildlife-spotting and temple-touring all in the space of a single day. Hedonists will delight in the party vibe of the major resorts, while the intrepid may test their mettle in some of the farthest-flung corners of civilization. This vast and enthralling country has something for everyone.</p>

	<p>Pura Ulun Danu was built in adoration of the Goddess Danu. Danu, in the Balinese tongue, means lake, while the goddess Danu is queen of water, lakes and rivers. The temple complex consists of four sacred buildings. Linga Pura stands three levels high, and is a place of worship to the god Shiva.</p>

	Another opinion is that red represents the human body or physical life, while white represents the soul or spiritual life; together they stand for a complete human being. As Sukarno said: Red is the symbol of courage, White is the symbol of purity. Our flag has been there for 600 years.
